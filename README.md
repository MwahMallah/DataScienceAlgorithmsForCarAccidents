# Data Science Algorithms for Car Accidents

This repository contains a collection of **Data Science algorithms applied to car accident datasets**. The goal of this project is to analyze traffic data, identify patterns, and build predictive models to better understand and prevent car accidents.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Various machine learning algorithms for prediction and classification
- Visualization of results and insights from traffic datasets

## Implemented Algorithms

### Classifier

A **Random Forest classifier** is implemented to predict outcomes related to car accidents based on available features. The classifier can handle complex data patterns and provides feature importance to help understand which factors contribute most to accidents.

## Datasets

The repository contains example datasets (CSV files) that include traffic and accident data. These datasets are used to train and test the machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MwahMallah/DataScienceAlgorithmsForCarAccidents.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts in the repository to perform analysis and predictions.
